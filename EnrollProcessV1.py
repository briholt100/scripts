#
#1 put csv files into folder to tidy
#2 make sure files are correctly named:  CampusQuarterYearEnrollments.csv eg:   NorthFall2012Enrollments
# make sure "Parse_Folder" , "f_loc", outfile_store, needs_work, below is correct
#3 run program
#4 call command "tidy()"
#5 paste or type the folder containing the files to tidy
#6 Enjoy
