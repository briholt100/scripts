#conceptual flow
""" I have the following code that works:
1. file_tidy(f_loc) which makes a new outfile of data with the correct campus and quarter put up front
2. filename_Parser(fileAddress) which returns the campus and quarter for a given fileAddres (csv)
3. identify_untidy(Parse_Folder) which returns a list of filenames (csv) that need tidying (the adding of campus and quarter)

So, something that takes the return of file_tidy, and then loops through each returned fileAddress and creates a
new outfile with "Tidy" in the file name."""
